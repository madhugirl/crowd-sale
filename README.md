## Challenge: Martian Token Crowdsale

Creating a crowdsale for the token "KaseiCoin".  

### Instructions

Follow the video instructions for information on how to deploy the KaseiCoin crowdsale contract.


#### Create the KaseiCoin Token Contract

In this section, you will create a smart contract that defines KaseiCoin as an ERC-20 token. To do so, complete the following steps:

1. Import the provided `KaseiCoin.sol` starter file into the Remix IDE.

2.  have immported the following contracts from the OpenZeppelin library:

    * `ERC20`

    * `ERC20Detailed`

    * `ERC20Mintable`

3. Define a contract for the KaseiCoin token called `KaseiCoin`, and have the contract inherit the three contracts that you just imported from OpenZeppelin.

4. Inside of your `KaseiCoin` contract, add a constructor with the following parameters: `name`, `symbol`, and `initial_supply`.

5. Then, as part of your constructor definition, add a call to the `ERC20Detailed` contractâ€™s constructor, passing the parameters `name`, `symbol`, and `18`. Recall that 18 is the value for the `decimal` parameter.
